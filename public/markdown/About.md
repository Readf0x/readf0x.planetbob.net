### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head">Music</span></div>

I love music, not so much making it as listening to it though, lol. I enjoy a wide variety of genres from japanese alt-rock to emo rap. I'm definitely not a "I listen to everything" person. I _despise_ hyperpop. My favorite artist is probably [Porter Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/@porterrobinson), but it'sd quite hard to pin down an overall favorite when you listen to as much as I do ðŸ˜….<br>
Some of my favorites include:

-   Arctic Monkeys
-   Foster the People
-   Gorillaz
-   Joji
-   King Gizzard
-   Lovejoy
-   Machine girl
-   Poorstacy
-   Tame Impala
-   The Academic
-   The Strokes
-   Tyler, The Creator
-   Wienners
-   Zutomayo
-   And more!

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head">Programming</span></div>

I've been a programmer since I was maybe ~11. It all started with [a video from a russian youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcOHNlNKPE) where he jokingly taught the basics of html. I was scared of javascript for a long time because I thought that I was too dumb to understand it, lol. I still don't properly know any high-level languages, despite my efforts to learn both java and kotlin.

```kotlin
int day = 1;
boolean caffeine = false;
switch(day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
        break;
    case 7:
        System.out.println("Saturday");
        break;
    default:
        if(caffeine) {
            System.out.println("Looking forward to the weekend!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("I'm going to kill myself");
        }
}
```

This terrible function is about the extent of my knowledge of kotlin... yeah. Despite these challenges, I have pursued front end web development to the point of making the site you're on right now! This site is written in [vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), with help from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). I'm using single-file components for all the elements on the site. The text you're reading right now is actually a [markdown file](/markdown/About.md) being compiled using [marked](https://marked.js.org/). The kotlin code block above was styled with [highight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). The navbar and the buttons on it use bootstrap, with custom styling from yours truly.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head">Keyboards</span></div>

I love custom keyboards (mechanical, to be specific). I built the keyboard I use at home and once I have a job I'll definitely be building another, better one. Right now my build consists of a GMMK TKL, filmed alpaca switches, and some cheap typewriter style keycaps I bought off amazon. Truly not the best setup, I know. I don't know what case I'm gonna use next, but I do know I'm gonna use gateron's oil kings or ink black switches. I definitely want to get an alice keyboard at sone point, because they look so cool, but I'm a little scared I won't get my money's worth because I've never used any layout other than the standard ansi one.
