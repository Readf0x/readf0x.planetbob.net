        span.head Music
p I love music, not so much making it as listening to it though, lol. I enjoy a wide variety of genres from japanese alt-rock to emo rap. I‚Äôm definitely not a ‚ÄúI listen to everything‚Äù person. I #[em despise] hyperpop. My favorite artist is probably #[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/@porterrobinson") Porter Robinson], but it‚Äôs quite hard to pin down an overall favorite when you listen to as much as I do üòÖ.#[br] Some of my favorites include:
ul
    li Arctic Monkeys
    li Foster the People
    li Gorillaz
    li Joji
    li King Gizzard

    li The Strokes

        span.head Programming
p I‚Äôve been a programmer since I was maybe ~11. It all started with #[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcOHNlNKPE") a video from a russian youtuber] where he jokingly taught the basics of html. I was scared of javascript for a long time because I thought that I was too dumb to understand it, lol. I still don‚Äôt properly know any high-level languages, despite my efforts to learn both java and kotlin.

                int day = 1;
                boolean caffeine = false;
                switch(day) {
                    case 1:
                        System.out.println("Sunday");
                        break;
                    case 7:
                        System.out.println("Saturday");
                        break;
                    default:
                        if(caffeine) {
                            System.out.println("Looking forward to the weekend!");
                        } else {
                            System.out.println("I'm going to kill myself");
                        }
                }
p This terrible function is about the extent of my knowledge of kotlin‚Ä¶ yeah. Despite these challenges, I have pursued front end web development to the point of making the site you‚Äôre on right now! This site is written in #[a(href="https://vuejs.org/") vue] and #[a(href="https://vitejs.dev/") vite], with help from #[a(href="https://getbootstrap.com/") bootstrap]. I‚Äôm using single-file components for all the elements on the site. The text you‚Äôre reading right now is actually #[a(href="https://pugjs.org") pug.js] code for performance reasons, but it was originally markdown being transformed with #[a(href="https://marked.js.org/") marked]. The kotlin code block above was styled with #[a(href="https://highlightjs.org/") highight.js]. The navbar and the buttons on it use bootstrap, with custom styling from yours truly.

        span.head Keyboards
p I love custom keyboards (mechanical, to be specific). I built the keyboard I use at home and once I have a job I‚Äôll definitely be building another, better one. Right now my build consists of a GMMK TKL, filmed alpaca switches, and some cheap typewriter style keycaps I bought off amazon. Truly not the best setup, I know. I don‚Äôt know what case I‚Äôm gonna use next, but I do know I‚Äôm gonna use gateron‚Äôs oil kings or ink black switches. I definitely want to get an alice keyboard at sone point, because they look so cool, but I‚Äôm a little scared I won‚Äôt get my money‚Äôs worth because I‚Äôve never used any layout other than the standard ansi one.
