<!-- finally clean*ish* markdown -->

Hey, I'm Davis Forsythe, but I go by readf0x online. I'm 16 and currently studying information technology at Desoto County Career Tech West. Some of my hobbies include custom keyboards and front end web development. I'm autistic with ADHD (not a very fun combination, believe me) and I try my best to keep up with school. I enjoy games like Portal 2, Half-Life 2, Fallout 4, H3VR, Unpacking, and ULTRAKILL.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Music</span></div>

I love music, not so much making it as listening to it though, lol. I enjoy a wide variety of genres from japanese alt-rock to emo rap. I'm definitely not a "I listen to everything" person. I _despise_ hyperpop. My favorite artist is probably [Porter Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/@porterrobinson), but it'sd quite hard to pin down an overall favorite when you listen to as much as I do ðŸ˜….<br>
Some of my favorites include:

-   Arctic Monkeys
-   Foster the People
-   Gorillaz
-   Joji
-   King Gizzard
-   Lovejoy
-   Machine girl
-   Poorstacy
-   Tame Impala
-   The Academic
-   The Strokes
-   Tyler, The Creator
-   Wienners
-   Zutomayo
-   And more!

I swear I don't play **_that_** much... Only a [_liiitle_](https://steamtime.info/s/76561198311420145)... :P

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Programming</span></div>

I've been a programmer since I was maybe ~11. It all started with [a video from a russian youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcOHNlNKPE) where he jokingly taught the basics of html. I was scared of javascript for a long time because I thought that I was too dumb to understand it, lol. I still don't properly know any high-level languages, despite my efforts to learn both java and kotlin.

```kotlin
int day = 1;
boolean caffeine = false;
switch(day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
        break;
    case 7:
        System.out.println("Saturday");
        break;
    default:
        if(caffeine) {
            System.out.println("Looking forward to the weekend!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("I'm going to kill myself");
        }
}
```

This terrible function is about the extent of my knowledge of kotlin... yeah. Despite these challenges, I have pursued front end web development to the point of making the site you're on right now! This site is written in [vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), with help from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). I'm using single-file components for all the elements on the site. The text you're reading right now is actually a [markdown file](/src/markdown/About.md) being compiled using [marked](https://marked.js.org/). The kotlin code block above was styled with [highight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). The navbar and the buttons on it use bootstrap, with custom styling from yours truly.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Keyboards</span></div>

I love custom keyboards (mechanical, to be specific). I built the keyboard I use at home and once I have a job I'll definitely be building another, better one. Right now my build consists of a GMMK TKL, filmed alpaca switches, and some cheap typewriter style keycaps I bought off amazon. Truly not the best setup, I know. I don't know what case I'm gonna use next, but I do know I'm gonna use gateron's oil kings or ink black switches. I definitely want to get an alice keyboard at sone point, because they look so cool, but I'm a little scared I won't get my money's worth because I've never used any layout other than the standard ansi one.
