<!-- finally clean*ish* markdown -->
Hey, I'm Davis Forsythe, but I go by readf0x online. I'm 16 and currently studying information technology at Desoto County Career Tech West. Some of my hobbies include custom keyboards and front end web development. I'm autistic with ADHD (not a very fun combination, believe me) and I try my best to keep up with school. I enjoy games like Portal 2, Half-Life 2, Fallout 4, H3VR, Unpacking, and ULTRAKILL.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Music</span></div>
I love music, not so much making it as listening to it though, lol. I enjoy a wide variety of genres from japanese alt-rock to emo rap. I'm definitely not a "I listen to everything" person. I *despise* hyperpop. My favorite artist is probably [Porter Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/@porterrobinson), but it'sd quite hard to pin down an overall favorite when you listen to as much as I do ðŸ˜….
