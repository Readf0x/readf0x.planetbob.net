## <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Projects</span></div>
I've worked on quite a few projects over the years, all of the notable ones being web-based. I actually no longer have access to quite a few "failed" projects, because if I didn't succeed in making whatever I was trying to make, I tended to nuke the source code. Big mistake, I know, but there's not much I can do about it now... Because of the non-existence of all failed projects, I don't have much to show on this page, But I'll show what I can.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Earliest work</span></div>
The earliest surviving code I've written belongs to a site I had to make for cyber foundations. I really went all-out, I didn't know much but I went way above and beyond what was required to pass.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">And then?</span></div>
After that... I have no clue what order things happened in. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ But I have gone through the trouble of keeping what was left running. This was my personal site before now. The barebones was written in nothing but html and css. No libraries, no javascript, nothin'. As mentioned on the [about page](/about/), I used to be scared of javascript, and all other actual programming languages, because it was "too hard" and I "wouldn't understand it" (I was a real piece of... *work* as a kid.)
