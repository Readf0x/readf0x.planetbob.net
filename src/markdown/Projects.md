## <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Projects</span></div>
I've worked on quite a few projects over the years, all of the notable ones being web-based. I actually no longer have access to quite a few "failed" projects, because if I didn't succeed in making whatever I was trying to make, I tended to nuke the source code. Big mistake, I know, but there's not much I can do about it now... Because of the non-existence of all failed projects, I don't have much to show on this page, But I'll show what I can.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Earliest work</span></div>
The earliest surviving code I've written belongs to a site I had to make for cyber foundations. I really went all-out, I didn't know much but I went way above and beyond what was required to pass. I've left it untouched for preservation purposes, besides the links to files, becuase they were all direct links to files on my computer at the time. Not exactly smart I know.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">And then?</span></div>
After that... I have no clue what order things happened in. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ But I have gone through the trouble of keeping what was left running. This was my personal site before now. The barebones was written in nothing but html and css. No libraries, no javascript, nothin'. As mentioned on the [about page](/about/), I used to be scared of javascript, and all other actual programming languages, because it was "too hard" and I "wouldn't understand it" (I was a real piece of... *work* as a kid.)

Notice how I say "I might learn Unity this summer!". This did not, in fact, happen.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">DVD Screensaver</span></div>
I was in my AP Human Geography class freshman year, and I found a [github repo](https://github.com/AlessioMaddaluno/bouncing-dvd-logo) of a basic DVD screensaver written in javascript. I added so many features it was practically a new piece of software.

### <div class="head-wrapper"><span class="head pe-1">Keyboard Layout Editor</span></div>
This project also began in my AP Human Geography class (It was really boring, lol). If you've read the [about page](/about/) (yes I'm linking it again, and no one can stop me) you'd know that my biggest hobby is custom keyboards. Well I found a site called [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) and liked it so much I made my own fork of it. I originally planned to add a *ton* of features that were *wayyy* beyond my skill level, so it didn't end up working out, lol.
